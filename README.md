## 💡 Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in:

- ⚽ Football (massive fan!)
- 🎶 Music
- 🎥 Good cinema
- 💪 Working out (weight and resistance training)

I'm also fascinated by the beauty of physics and can talk for hours about it. Recently, I've been diving deep into the realms of AI and ML, aiming to become a stellar engineer in this field.

- 🚀 I focus on creating unique projects rather than just following the crowd with usual capstone projects.
- 🏋️ My work ethic is as disciplined as my gym routine. Consistency and dedication are key!
