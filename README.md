## 🎓 About Me

I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science engineering undergrad from a state-level college in India. Currently, I'm on the hunt for exciting internship opportunities while continuously learning new tech and skills. I am currently working on building my own 2FA system along with a workout based app/platform.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Here's what I rock when it comes to technology:

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, SQL, MATLAB
- **Web Development:** Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **ML:** Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn
- **Databases:** MySQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **Tools:** GitHub, PostMan, PyCharm

## 💡 Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in:

- 💪 Working out (weight and resistance training)
- 🎶 Music
- 🎥 Good cinema (Nolan, Spielberg, Scorsese, Tarantino, Fincher, Russo's) => 😮‍💨🗿
- ⚽ Football (massive fan!)

I'm also fascinated by the beauty of physics and can talk for hours about it. 

🏋️ My work ethic is as disciplined as my gym routine. Consistency and dedication are key!
